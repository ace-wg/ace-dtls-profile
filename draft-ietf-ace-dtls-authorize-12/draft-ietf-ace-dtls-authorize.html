</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This specification defines a profile of the ACE framework <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>.  In this profile, a client and a resource server use CoAP <a href="#RFC7252" class="xref">[RFC7252]</a> over DTLS version 1.2 <a href="#RFC6347" class="xref">[RFC6347]</a> to communicate. The client obtains an access token, bound to a key (the proof-of-possession key), from an authorization server to prove its authorization to access protected resources hosted by the resource server. Also, the client and the resource server are provided by the authorization server with the necessary keying material to establish a DTLS session. The communication between client and authorization server may also be secured with DTLS.  This specification supports DTLS with Raw Public Keys (RPK) <a href="#RFC7250" class="xref">[RFC7250]</a> and with Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) <a href="#RFC4279" class="xref">[RFC4279]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The ACE framework requires that client and server mutually authenticate each other before any application data is exchanged.  DTLS enables mutual authentication if both client and server prove their ability to use certain keying material in the DTLS handshake.  The authorization server assists in this process on the server side by incorporating keying material (or information about keying material) into the access token, which is considered a &#8220;proof of possession&#8221; token.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">In the RPK mode, the client proves that it can use the RPK bound to the token and the server shows that it can use a certain RPK.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">The resource server needs access to the token in order to complete this exchange.  For the RPK mode, the client must upload the access token to the resource server before initiating the handshake, as described in Section 5.8.1 of the ACE framework <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">In the PSK mode, client and server show with the DTLS handshake that they can use the keying material that is bound to the access token.  To transfer the access token from the client to the resource server, the <samp>psk_identity</samp> parameter in the DTLS PSK handshake may be used instead of uploading the token prior to the handshake.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">As recommended in Section 5.8 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>, this specification uses CBOR web tokens to convey claims within an access token issued by the server.  While other formats could be used as well, those are out of scope for this document.</p>

The term <samp>claim</samp> is used in this document with the same semantics as in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>, i.e., it denotes information carried in the access token or returned from introspection.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The CoAP-DTLS profile for ACE specifies the transfer of authentication information and, if necessary, authorization information between the client (C) and the resource server (RS) during setup of a DTLS session for CoAP messaging. It also specifies how the client can use CoAP over DTLS to retrieve an access token from the authorization server (AS) for a protected resource hosted on the resource server.  As specified in Section 6.7 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>, use of DTLS for one or both of these interactions is completely independent</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">This profile requires the client to retrieve an access token for protected resource(s) it wants to access on the resource server as specified in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>. <a href="#at-retrieval" class="xref">Figure 1</a> shows the typical message flow in this scenario (messages in square brackets are optional):</p>

<p class="figure">Figure 1: Retrieving an Access Token</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">To determine the authorization server in charge of a resource hosted at the resource server, the client can send an initial Unauthorized Resource Request message to the resource server. The resource server then denies the request and sends an AS Request Creation Hints message containing the address of its authorization server back to the client as specified in Section 5.1.2 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">Once the client knows the authorization server&#8217;s address, it can send an access token request to the token endpoint at the authorization server as specified in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>. As the access token request as well as the response may contain confidential data, the communication between the client and the authorization server must be confidentiality-protected and ensure authenticity. The client may have been registered at the authorization server via the OAuth 2.0 client registration mechanism as outlined in Section 5.3 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">The access token returned by the authorization server can then be used by the client to establish a new DTLS session with the resource server. When the client intends to use an asymmetric proof-of-possession key in the DTLS handshake with the resource server, the client MUST upload the access token to the authz-info resource, i.e. the authz-info endpoint, on the resource server before starting the DTLS handshake, as described in Section 5.8.1 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>. In case the client uses a symmetric proof-of-possession key in the DTLS handshake, the procedure as above MAY be used, or alternatively, the access token MAY instead be transferred in the DTLS ClientKeyExchange message (see <a href="#psk-dtls-channel" class="xref">Section 3.3.1</a>).  In any case, DTLS MUST be used in a mode that provides replay protection.</p>

Instead of providing the keying material in the access token, the authorization server includes the key identifier in the <samp>kid</samp> parameter, see <a href="#kdf-cnf" class="xref">Figure 7</a>. This key identifier enables the resource server to calculate the symmetric key used for the communication with the client using the key derivation key and a KDF to be defined by the application, for example HKDF-SHA-256.

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">The client can therefore update the authorization information stored at the resource server at any time without changing an established DTLS session.

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">The resource server MUST delete access tokens that are no longer valid.  DTLS associations that have been setup in accordance with this profile are always tied to specific tokens (which may be exchanged with a dynamic update as described in Section 4).

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">As specified in the ACE framework (Sections 5.6 and 5.7 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>), the requesting entity (the resource server and/or the client) and the authorization server communicate via the token endpoint or introspection endpoint.  The use of CoAP and DTLS for this communication is RECOMMENDED in this profile, other protocols (such as HTTP and TLS, or CoAP and OSCORE <a href="#RFC8613" class="xref">[RFC8613]</a>) MAY be used instead.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">How credentials (e.g., PSK, RPK, X.509 cert) for using DTLS with the authorization server are established is out of scope for this profile.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">If other means of securing the communication with the authorization server are used, the communication security requirements from Section 6.2 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a> remain applicable.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> <a href="#security-considerations" id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">This document specifies a profile for the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>. As it follows this framework&#8217;s general approach, the general security considerations from Section 6 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a> also apply to this profile.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">The authorization server must ascertain that the keying material for the client that it provides to the resource server actually is associated with this client.  Malicious clients may hand over access tokens containing their own access permissions to other entities. This problem cannot be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, in RPK mode it should not be possible for clients to request access tokens for arbitrary public keys: if the client can cause the authorization server to issue a token for a public key without proving possession of the corresponding private key, this allows for identity misbinding attacks where the issued token is usable by an entity other than the intended one.  The authorization server therefore at some point needs to validate that the client can actually use the private key corresponding to the client&#8217;s public key.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">When using pre-shared keys provisioned by the authorization server, the security level depends on the randomness of PSK, and the security of the TLS cipher suite and key exchange algorithm.  As this specification targets at constrained environments, message payloads exchanged between the client and the resource server are expected to be small and rare.  CoAP <a href="#RFC7252" class="xref">[RFC7252]</a> mandates the implementation of cipher suites with abbreviated, 8-byte tags for message integrity protection. For consistency, this profile requires implementation of the same cipher suites. For application scenarios where the cost of full-width authentication tags is low compared to the overall amount of data being transmitted, the use of cipher suites with 16-byte integrity protection tags is preferred.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">The PSK mode of this profile offers a distribution mechanism to convey authorization tokens together with a shared secret to a client and a server. As this specification aims at constrained devices and uses CoAP <a href="#RFC7252" class="xref">[RFC7252]</a> as transfer protocol, at least the ciphersuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 <a href="#RFC6655" class="xref">[RFC6655]</a> should be supported. The access tokens and the corresponding shared secrets generated by the authorization server are expected to be sufficiently short-lived to provide similar forward-secrecy properties to using ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) key exchange mechanisms. For longer-lived access tokens, DHE ciphersuites should be used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.5">Constrained devices that use DTLS <a href="#RFC6347" class="xref">[RFC6347]</a> are inherently vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks as the handshake protocol requires creation of internal state within the device.  This is specifically of concern where an adversary is able to intercept the initial cookie exchange and interject forged messages with a valid cookie to continue with the handshake. A similar issue exists with the unprotected authorization information endpoint where the resource server needs to keep valid access tokens until their expiry. Adversaries can fill up the constrained resource server&#8217;s internal storage for a very long time with interjected or otherwise retrieved valid access tokens.  The protection of access tokens that are stored in the authorization information endpoint depends on the keying material that is used between the authorization server and the resource server: The resource server must ensure that it processes only access tokens that are (encrypted and) integrity-protected by an authorization server that is authorized to provide access tokens for the resource server.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1">7.1.</a> <a href="#reuse-of-existing-sessions" id="reuse-of-existing-sessions">Reuse of Existing Sessions</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">To avoid the overhead of a repeated DTLS handshake, <a href="#RFC7925" class="xref">[RFC7925]</a> recommends session resumption <a href="#RFC5077" class="xref">[RFC5077]</a> to reuse session state from an earlier DTLS association and thus requires client side implementation.  In this specification, the DTLS session is subject to the authorization rules denoted by the access token that was used for the initial setup of the DTLS association. Enabling session resumption would require the server to transfer the authorization information with the session state in an encrypted SessionTicket to the client. Assuming that the server uses long-lived keying material, this could open up attacks due to the lack of forward secrecy. Moreover, using this mechanism, a client can resume a DTLS session without proving the possession of the PoP key again. Therefore, the use of session resumption is NOT RECOMMENDED for resource servers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">Since renegotiation of DTLS associations is prone to attacks as well, <a href="#RFC7925" class="xref">[RFC7925]</a> requires clients to decline any renogiation attempt. A server that wants to initiate re-keying therefore SHOULD periodically force a full handshake.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2">7.2.</a> <a href="#multiple-access-tokens" id="multiple-access-tokens">Multiple Access Tokens</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">The use of multiple access tokens for a single client increases the strain on the resource server as it must consider every access token and calculate the actual permissions of the client. Also, tokens may contradict each other which may lead the server to enforce wrong permissions. If one of the access tokens expires earlier than others, the resulting permissions may offer insufficient protection. Developers SHOULD avoid using multiple access tokens for a client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.2">Even when a single access token per client is used, an attacker could compromise the dynamic update mechanism for existing DTLS connections by delaying or reordering packets destined for the authz-info endpoint. Thus, the order in which operations occur at the resource server (and thus which authorization info is used to process a given client request) cannot be guaranteed.  Especially in the presence of later-issued access tokens that reduce the client&#8217;s permissions from the initial access token, it is impossible to guarantee that the reduction in authorization will take effect prior to the expiration of the original token.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">To communicate securely, the authorization server, the client and the resource server require certain information that must be exchanged outside the protocol flow described in this document. The authorization server must have obtained authorization information concerning the client and the resource server that is approved by the resource owner as well as corresponding keying material. The resource server must have received authorization information approved by the resource owner concerning its authorization managers and the respective keying material. The client must have obtained authorization information concerning the authorization server approved by its owner as well as the corresponding keying material. Also, the client&#8217;s owner must have approved of the client&#8217;s communication with the resource server. The client and the authorization server must have obtained a common understanding how this resource server is identified to ensure that the client obtains access token and keying material for the correct resource server. If the client is provided with a raw public key for the resource server, it must be ascertained to which resource server (which identifier and authorization information) the key is associated.  All authorization information and keying material must be kept up to date.</p>
