Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Profile for Authentication and
            Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE)
                  draft-ietf-ace-dtls-authorize-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a profile for delegating client
   authentication and authorization in a constrained environment by
   establishing a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) channel
   between resource-constrained nodes.  The protocol relies on DTLS for
   communication security between entities in a constrained network
   using either raw public keys or pre-shared keys.  A resource-
   constrained node can use this protocol to delegate management of
   authorization information to a trusted host with less severe
   limitations regarding processing power and memory.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a profile of the ACE framework
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  In this profile, a client and a resource
   server use CoAP [RFC7252] over DTLS [RFC6347] to communicate.  The
   client uses an access token, bound to a key (the proof-of-possession
   key) to authorize its access to protected resources hosted by the
   resource server.  DTLS provides communication security, proof of
   possession, and server authentication.  Optionally the client and the
   resource server may also use CoAP over DTLS to communicate with the
   authorization server.  This specification supports the DTLS handshake

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-DTLS                   October 2018


   with Raw Public Keys (RPK) [RFC7250] and the DTLS handshake with Pre-
   Shared Keys (PSK) [RFC4279].

   The DTLS RPK handshake [RFC7250] requires client authentication to
   provide proof-of-possession for the key tied to the access token.
   Here the access token needs to be transferred to the resource server
   before the handshake is initiated, as described in section 5.8.1 of
   draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz [1].

   The DTLS PSK handshake [RFC4279] provides the proof-of-possession for
   the key tied to the access token.  Furthermore the psk_identity
   parameter in the DTLS PSK handshake is used to transfer the access
   token from the client to the resource server.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

2.  Protocol Overview

   The CoAP-DTLS profile for ACE specifies the transfer of
   authentication and, if necessary, authorization information between
   the client C and the resource server RS during setup of a DTLS
   session for CoAP messaging.  It also specifies how a Client can use
   CoAP over DTLS to retrieve an Access Token from the authorization
   server AS for a protected resource hosted on the resource server RS.

   This profile requires a Client (C) to retrieve an Access Token for
   the resource(s) it wants to access on a Resource Server (RS) as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  Figure 1 shows the typical
   message flow in this scenario (messages in square brackets are
   optional):

      C                            RS                   AS
      | [-- Resource Request --->] |                     |
      |                            |                     |
      | [<----- AS Information --] |                     |

      | <---------------------------- Access Token ----- |
      |                               + RS Information   |


                   Figure 1: Retrieving an Access Token

   To determine the AS in charge of a resource hosted at the RS, the
   client C MAY send an initial Unauthorized Resource Request message to
   the RS.  The RS then denies the request and sends the address of its
   AS back to the client C as specified in section 5.1.2 of draft-ietf-
   ace-oauth-authz [2].

   Once the client C knows the authorization server's address, it can
   send an Access Token request to the token endpoint at the AS as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  As the Access Token request
   as well as the response may contain confidential data, the
   communication between the client and the authorization server MUST be
   confidentiality-protected and ensure authenticity.  How the mutual
   authentication between the client and the authorization server is
   achieved is out of scope for this document; the client may have been
   configured with a public key of the authorization server and have
   been registered at the AS via the OAuth client registration mechanism
   as outlined in section 5.3 of draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz [3].

   If C wants to use the CoAP RawPublicKey mode as described in
   Section 9 of RFC 7252 [4] it MUST provide a key or key identifier
   within a "cnf" object in the token request.  If the authorization
   server AS decides that the request is to be authorized it generates
   an access token response for the client C containing a "profile"
   parameter with the value "coap_dtls" to indicate that this profile
   MUST be used for communication between the client C and the resource
   server.

   For RPK mode, the authorization server also adds a "rs_cnf" parameter
   containing information about the public that is used by the resource
   server (see Section 3).

   For PSK mode, the authorization server adds a "cnf" parameter
   containing information about the shared secret that C can use to
   setup a DTLS session with the resource server (see Section 4).

   The Access Token returned by the authorization server then can be
   used by the client to establish a new DTLS session with the resource
   server.  When the client intends to use asymmetric cryptography in
   the DTLS handshake with the resource server, the client MUST upload
   the Access Token to the authz-info resource on the resource server
   before starting the DTLS handshake, as described in section 5.8.1 of
   draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz [5].  If only symmetric cryptography is
   used between the client and the resource server, the Access Token MAY
   instead be transferred in the DTLS ClientKeyExchange message (see
   Section 4.1).

   Figure 2 depicts the common protocol flow for the DTLS profile after
   the client C has retrieved the Access Token from the authorization
   server AS.

                        Figure 2: Protocol overview

   The following sections specify how CoAP is used to interchange
   access-related data between the resource server and the authorization
   server so that the authorization server can provide the client and
   the resource server with sufficient information to establish a secure
   channel, and convey authorization information specific for this
   communication relationship to the resource server.

   Depending on the desired CoAP security mode, the Client-to-AS
   request, AS-to-Client response and DTLS session establishment carry
   slightly different information.  Section 3 addresses the use of raw
   public keys while Section 4 defines how pre-shared keys are used in
   this profile.

2.1.  Resource Access

   Once a DTLS channel has been established as described in Section 3
   and Section 4, respectively, the client is authorized to access
   resources covered by the Access Token it has uploaded to the authz-
   info resource hosted by the resource server.

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-DTLS                   October 2018


   On the resource server side, successful establishment of the DTLS
   channel binds the client to the access token, functioning as a proof-
   of-possession associated key.  Any request that the resource server
   receives on this channel MUST be checked against these authorization
   rules that are associated with the identity of the client.  Incoming
   CoAP requests that are not authorized with respect to any Access
   Token that is associated with the client MUST be rejected by the
   resource server with 4.01 response as described in Section 5.1.1 of
   draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz [6].

   Note: The identity of the client is determined by the authentication
   process
      during the DTLS handshake.  In the asymmetric case, the public key
      will define the client's identity, while in the PSK case, the
      client's identity is defined by the shared secret generated by the
      authorization server for this communication.

   The resource server SHOULD treat an incoming CoAP request as
   authorized if the following holds:

   1.  The message was received on a secure channel that has been
       established using the procedure defined in this document.

   2.  The authorization information tied to the sending peer is valid.

   3.  The request is destined for the resource server.

   4.  The resource URI specified in the request is covered by the
       authorization information.

   5.  The request method is an authorized action on the resource with
       respect to the authorization information.

   Incoming CoAP requests received on a secure DTLS channel MUST be
   rejected according to [Section 5.1.1 of draft-ietf-ace-oauth-
   authz](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-
   13#section-5.1.1

   1.  with response code 4.03 (Forbidden) when the resource URI
       specified in the request is not covered by the authorization
       information, and

   2.  with response code 4.05 (Method Not Allowed) when the resource
       URI specified in the request covered by the authorization
       information but not the requested action.

   The client cannot always know a priori if an Authorized Resource
   Request will succeed.  If the client repeatedly gets error responses

   containing AS Information (cf.  Section 5.1.1 of draft-ietf-ace-
   oauth-authz [7] as response to its requests, it SHOULD request a new
   Access Token from the authorization server in order to continue
   communication with the resource server.

2.2.  Dynamic Update of Authorization Information

   The client can update the authorization information stored at the
   resource server at any time without changing an established DTLS
   session.  To do so, the Client requests from the authorization server
   a new Access Token for the intended action on the respective resource
   and uploads this Access Token to the authz-info resource on the
   resource server.

   Figure 3 depicts the message flow where the client C requests a new
   Access Token after a security association between the client and the
   resource server RS has been established using this protocol.  The
   token request MUST specify the key identifier of the existing DTLS
   channel between the client and the resource server in the "kid"
   parameter of the Client-to-AS request.  The authorization server MUST
   verify that the specified "kid" denotes a valid verifier for a proof-
   of-possession ticket that has previously been issued to the
   requesting client.  Otherwise, the Client-to-AS request MUST be
   declined with a the error code "unsupported_pop_key" as defined in
   Section 5.6.3 of draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz [8].

   When the authorization server issues a new access token to update
   existing authorization information it MUST include the specified
   "kid" parameter in this access token.  A resource server MUST
   associate the updated authorization information with any existing
   DTLS session that is identified by this key identifier.

   Note: By associating the access tokens with the identifier of an
      existing DTLS session, the authorization information can be
      updated without changing the cryptographic keys for the DTLS
      communication between the client and the resource server, i.e. an
      existing session can be used with updated permissions.

              Figure 3: Overview of Dynamic Update Operation

2.3.  Token Expiration

   DTLS sessions that have been established in accordance with this
   profile are always tied to a specific set of access tokens.  As these
   tokens may become invalid at any time (either because the token has
   expired or the responsible authorization server has revoked the
   token), the session may become useless at some point.  A resource
   server therefore may decide to terminate existing DTLS sessions after
   the last valid access token for this session has been deleted.

   As specified in section 5.8.3 of draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz [9], the
   resource server MUST notify the client with an error response with
   code 4.01 (Unauthorized) for any long running request before
   terminating the session.

   The resource server MAY also keep the session alive for some time and
   respond to incoming requests with a 4.01 (Unauthorized) error message
   including AS Information to signal that the client needs to upload a
   new access token before it can continue using this DTLS session.  The
   AS Information is created as specified in section 5.1.2 of draft-
   ietf-ace-oauth-authz [10].  The resource server SHOULD add a "kid"
   parameter to the AS Information denoting the identifier of the key
   that it uses internally for this DTLS session.  The client then
   includes this "kid" parameter in a Client-to-AS request used to
   retrieve a new access token to be used with this DTLS session.  In
   case the key identifier is already known by the client (e.g. because
   it was included in the RS Information in an AS-to-Client response),
   the "kid" parameter MAY be elided from the AS Information.

3.  RawPublicKey Mode

   To retrieve an access token for the resource that the client wants to
   access, the client requests an Access Token from the authorization
   server.  The client MUST add a "cnf" object carrying either its raw
   public key or a unique identifier for a public key that it has
   previously made known to the authorization server.  To prove that the
   client is in possession of this key, it MUST use the same public key
   as in certificate message that is used to establish the DTLS session
   with the authorization server.

   An example Access Token request from the client to the resource
   server is depicted in Figure 4.

   the client initiates the DTLS handshake with the resource server, it
   MUST send a "POST" request containing the new Access Token to the
   authz-info resource hosted by the resource server.  If this operation
   yields a positive response, the client SHOULD proceed to establish a
   new DTLS channel with the resource server.  To use raw public key
   mode, the client MUST pass the same public key that was used for
   constructing the Access Token with the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure
   in the DTLS handshake as specified in [RFC7250].

   An implementation that supports the RPK mode of this profile MUST at
   least support the ciphersuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8
   [RFC7251] with the ed25519 curve (cf.  [RFC8032], [RFC8422]).

   Note:  According to [RFC7252], CoAP implementations MUST support the
      ciphersuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 [RFC7251] and the
      NIST P-256 curve.  As discussed in [RFC7748], new ECC curves have
      been defined recently that are considered superior to the so-
      called NIST curves.  The curve that is mandatory to implement in
      this specification is said to be efficient and less dangerous
      regarding implementation errors than the secp256r1 curve mandated
      in [RFC7252].

   The Access Token is constructed by the authorization server such that
   the resource server can associate the Access Token with the Client's
   public key.  If CBOR web tokens [RFC8392] are used as recommended in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], the authorization server MUST include a
   "COSE_Key" object in the "cnf" claim of the Access Token.  This
   "COSE_Key" object MAY contain a reference to a key for the client
   that is already known by the resource server (e.g., from previous
   communication).  If the authorization server has no certain knowledge
   that the Client's key is already known to the resource server, the
   Client's public key MUST be included in the Access Token's "cnf"
   parameter.

4.  PreSharedKey Mode

   To retrieve an access token for the resource that the client wants to
   access, the client MAY include a "cnf" object carrying an identifier
   for a symmetric key in its Access Token request to the authorization
   server.  This identifier can be used by the authorization server to
   determine the shared secret to construct the proof-of-possession
   token and therefore MUST specify a symmetric key that was previously
   generated by the authorization server as a shared secret for the
   communication between the client and the resource server.

   Depending on the requested token type and algorithm in the Access
   Token request, the authorization server adds RS Information to the
   response that provides the client with sufficient information to

   setup a DTLS channel with the resource server.  For symmetric proof-
   of-possession keys (c.f.  [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]), the client
   must ensure that the Access Token request is sent over a secure
   channel that guarantees authentication, message integrity and
   confidentiality.

   When the authorization server authorizes the client it returns an AS-
   to-Client response with the profile parameter set to "coap_dtls" and
   a "cnf" parameter carrying a "COSE_Key" object that contains the
   symmetric key to be used between the client and the resource server
   as illustrated in Figure 5.

4.1.  DTLS Channel Setup Between C and RS

   When a client receives an Access Token from an authorization server,
   it checks if the payload contains an "access_token" parameter and a
   "cnf" parameter.  With this information the client can initiate
   establishment of a new DTLS channel with a resource server.  To use
   DTLS with pre-shared keys, the client follows the PSK key exchange
   algorithm specified in Section 2 of [RFC4279] using the key conveyed
   in the "cnf" parameter of the AS response as PSK when constructing
   the premaster secret.

   In PreSharedKey mode, the knowledge of the shared secret by the
   client and the resource server is used for mutual authentication
   between both peers.  Therefore, the resource server must be able to
   determine the shared secret from the Access Token.  Following the
   general ACE authorization framework, the client can upload the Access
   Token to the resource server's authz-info resource before starting
   the DTLS handshake.  Alternatively, the client MAY provide the most
   recent Access Token in the "psk_identity" field of the
   ClientKeyExchange message.  To do so, the client MUST treat the
   contents of the "access_token" field from the AS-to-Client response
   as opaque data and not perform any re-coding.

   Note: As stated in section 4.2 of [RFC7925], the PSK identity should
   be treated as binary data in the Internet of Things space and not
   assumed to have a human-readable form of any sort.

   If a resource server receives a ClientKeyExchange message that
   contains a "psk_identity" with a length greater zero, it uses the
   contents as index for its key store (i.e., treat the contents as key
   identifier).  The resource server MUST check if it has one or more
   Access Tokens that are associated with the specified key.  If no
   valid Access Token is available for this key, the DTLS session setup
   is terminated with an "illegal_parameter" DTLS alert message.

   If no key with a matching identifier is found the resource server the
   resource server MAY process the decoded contents of the
   "psk_identity" field as access token that is stored with the
   authorization information endpoint before continuing the DTLS
   handshake.  If the decoded contents of the "psk_identity" do not
   yield a valid access token for the requesting client, the DTLS
   session setup is terminated with an "illegal_parameter" DTLS alert
   message.

   Note1: As a resource server cannot provide a client with a meaningful
    PSK identity hint in
      response to the client's ClientHello message, the resource server
      SHOULD NOT send a ServerKeyExchange message.

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-DTLS                   October 2018


   Note2:  According to [RFC7252], CoAP implementations MUST support the
      ciphersuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 [RFC6655].  A client is
      therefore expected to offer at least this ciphersuite to the
      resource server.

   This specification assumes that the Access Token is a PoP token as
   described in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] unless specifically stated
   otherwise.  Therefore, the Access Token is bound to a symmetric PoP
   key that is used as shared secret between the client and the resource
   server.

   While the client can retrieve the shared secret from the contents of
   the "cnf" parameter in the AS-to-Client response, the resource server
   uses the information contained in the "cnf" claim of the Access Token
   to determine the actual secret when no explicit "kid" was provided in
   the "psk_identity" field.  Usually, this is done by including a
   "COSE_Key" object carrying either a key that has been encrypted with
   a shared secret between the authorization server and the resource
   server, or a key identifier that can be used by the resource server
   to lookup the shared secret.

   Instead of the "COSE_Key" object, the authorization server MAY
   include a "COSE_Encrypt" structure to enable the resource server to
   calculate the shared key from the Access Token.  The "COSE_Encrypt"
   structure MUST use the _Direct Key with KDF_ method as described in
   Section 12.1.2 of RFC 8152 [13].  The authorization server MUST
   include a Context information structure carrying a PartyU "nonce"
   parameter carrying the nonce that has been used by the authorization
   server to construct the shared key.

   This specification mandates that at least the key derivation
   algorithm "HKDF SHA-256" as defined in [RFC8152] MUST be supported.
   This key derivation function is the default when no "alg" field is
   included in the "COSE_Encrypt" structure for the resource server.

4.2.  Updating Authorization Information

   Usually, the authorization information that the resource server keeps
   for a client is updated by uploading a new Access Token as described
   in Section 2.2.

   The Client MAY also perform a new DTLS handshake according to
   Section 4.1 that replaces the existing DTLS session.  After
   successful completion of the DTLS handshake the resource server
   updates the existing authorization information for the client
   according to the new Access Token.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a profile for the Authentication and
   Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  As it follows this framework's general
   approach, the general security and privacy considerations from
   section 6 and section 7 also apply to this profile.

   Constrained devices that use DTLS [RFC6347] are inherently vulnerable
   to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks as the handshake protocol requires
   creation of internal state within the device.  This is specifically
   of concern where an adversary is able to intercept the initial cookie
   exchange and interject forged messages with a valid cookie to
   continue with the handshake.

   [I-D.tiloca-tls-dos-handshake] specifies a TLS extension to prevent
   this type of attack which is applicable especially for constrained
   environments where the authorization server can act as trust anchor.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   An unprotected response to an unauthorized request may disclose
   information about the resource server and/or its existing
   relationship with the client.  It is advisable to include as little
   information as possible in an unencrypted response.  When a DTLS
   session between the client and the resource server already exists,
   more detailed information may be included with an error response to
   provide the client with sufficient information to react on that
   particular error.

   Note that some information might still leak after DTLS session is
   established, due to observable message sizes, the source, and the
   destination addresses.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The following registrations are done for the ACE OAuth Profile
   Registry following the procedure specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

   with the RFC number of this specification and delete this paragraph.
